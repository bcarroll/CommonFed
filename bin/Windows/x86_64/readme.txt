These are experimental 64bit binaries. 
32bit binaries 
built using the same method are included in the Win32 folder.


The libraries in these packages are made using GCC (MinGW) toolchain. 
It is 
presently not possible to use these libraries with any recent version of the 
Microsoft Visual C compiler because of conflicting C-runtimes. 
To help you 
resist the temptation, the import libraries (.LIB) are not provided at all. 

If you need these libraries in an environment which mandates the use of the 
Microsoft toolchain, you will have to build them from source yourself.
